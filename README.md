**AUTOMATED CAR VALUATION USING MACHINE LEARNING**

• Implemented polynomial and linear regression techniques to predict car values based on input data, targeting 85% accuracy for the model.
• Deployed CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment, reducing downtime and manual intervention by 50%.
• Leveraged JavaScript to perform asynchronous HTTP requests to RESTful APIs, sending user input to the car valuation
model and retrieving results in real-time by reducing the initial load time by 40%.
• Collaborated with a team of 4 to integrate the model into a web application, facilitating user-friendly access to car valuations.
• Formulated data visualization techniques to present valuation results clearly, boosting user understanding and decision making by 25%.
